title:Camel not the Burro

              It's the Camel Not the Burro

It's the camel not the burro
They take the burro, the camel walks away
Thie meaning is obscured, but true
Isreal, Kerry, Obaom, and Trump take their turn
This sets the stage

He takes it to a new location
Where it can do the most good
One leader is killed, the other get's his way
He looks closer on the few
His name is Isis, his view is on one thing
He pays much for it
It's on the Camel
No one knows it's there
Then when the time is right
America finds their demise

America blames the wrong one
Then Retribution

No one on our side can believe the Americans are so dumb
They are either dead or greatly saddened 
They are placed in the Sun
There is no forgiveness
The New World is born
